Inheritance in Java![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112891230/236472684-153277a1-ea8d-4e6b-b7f6-7a044b4448d2.png)

Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs(Object Oriented programming system).
The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.

Java try block![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112891230/236472878-77da6e5e-0608-4b37-93a3-a4c651e81f2a.png)

Java try block is used to enclose the code that might throw an exception. It must be used within the method.
If an exception occurs at the particular statement in the try block, the rest of the block code will not execute. So, it is recommended not to keep the code in try block that will not throw an exception.

Java catch block![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112891230/236472969-838db5ef-7584-4663-97bd-249eba569292.png)

Java catch block is used to handle the Exception by declaring the type of exception within the parameter. The declared exception must be the parent class exception or the generated exception type. However, the good approach is to declare the generated type of exception.
The catch block must be used after the try block only. You can use multiple catch block with a single try block.

HashMap![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112891230/236473068-bc84954e-4dea-4fd0-873c-4bd2c032dab1.png)

Java HashMap class implements the Map interface which allows us to store key and value pair, where keys should be unique. If you try to insert the duplicate key, it will replace the element of the corresponding key. It is easy to perform operations using the key index like updation, deletion, etc. HashMap class is found in the java.util package![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112891230/236473104-c68ea2bb-8431-494b-b6c3-41aaae1d450c.png)
